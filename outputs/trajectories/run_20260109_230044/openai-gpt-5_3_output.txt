"reasoning_and_reflection": "We’ve accepted two orders with same pickup; both still preparing (3–5 min). Best use of time is to head toward the restaurant so we’re ready when food is done. Battery 50% is enough for the ~300–500 m trips; no need to charge now. Maintain normal pace to avoid food damage later.",
"action": "MOVE(-288.53m, -16.58m)",
"future_plan": "Arrive at pickup door and wait if needed. Once both are ready, PICKUP both, arrange via PLACE_FOOD_IN_BAG, then deliver order #6 first to (-176.97m,-125.79m) with leave_at_door, then order #5 to (-304.10m,-224.68m). Monitor energy/battery; charge only if needed after deliveries."
