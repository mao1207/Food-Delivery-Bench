"reasoning_and_reflection": "I’m at the pickup door for orders #5 and #6. Both are still being prepared (#6 ~2 min, #5 ~4 min). Battery 38% is adequate for these deliveries; energy 97% is fine. Best move is to wait at the pickup so I can grab food immediately when ready.",

"future_plan": "When #6 becomes ready, PICKUP it (and #5 if ready). Arrange items in bag and add heat/ice packs if required. Deliver #6 first to (-176.97,-125.79), then return along route to drop off #5 at (-304.10,-224.68). Charge scooter afterward if battery dips below ~20%."
