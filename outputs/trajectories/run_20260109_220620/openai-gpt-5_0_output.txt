"reasoning_and_reflection": "We have order #7 in bag and close to its pickup spot; need to deliver 611.6 m away with 32% scooter battery (range ~806 m), which is sufficient to reach dropoff, but likely tight afterward. Prioritize timely drop for order #7 (4 min left) using knock as requested, then evaluate battery and route toward order #1 pickup (food ready in ~1 min from earlier; now likely ready).",

"future_plan": "On arrival, DROP_OFF(oid=7, method=\"knock\"). If scooter batt <=15–20%, go to charging_station 10 at (-436.72m, -212.00m) for a short top-up; otherwise head to restaurant 3 (-424.45m, 53.15m) to PICKUP order #1, bag it, then MOVE to its dropoff (219.40m, -108.99m). Monitor time left for order #1 and energy; use store/charge only if needed."
