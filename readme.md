## 💡 Introduction

**DeliveryBench** is a city-scale embodied benchmark that evaluates whether VLM agents can earn profit under realistic, long-horizon constraints. Agents act as autonomous couriers in 3D cities, accepting and completing delivery orders across multiple in-game hours. They must manage resources (e.g., stamina, e-scooter battery), adapt to changing conditions, and balance efficiency, timing, and cost. When multiple agents coexist, they also face social dynamics such as competition and collaboration. By jointly modeling economic, physical, and social dynamics within a unified embodied environment, DeliveryBench provides a realistic, action-driven setting to test whether VLM-based agents can plan and act strategically to improve financial outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Features

Compared with prior embodied benchmarks, DeliveryBench supports long-horizon tasks (several in-game hours; typically > 100 action steps) with multi-dimensional real-world constraints, covering:

**⏳ Time Constraints**: Tasks have deadlines and time windows that determine when they can be performed.
Agents must schedule actions to avoid late deliveries and make efficient use of limited working time.

**🗺️ Spatial Constraints**: Some actions are only valid at specific locations, so agents must navigate 3D cities and visit the right POIs in the right order (e.g., restaurants, charging stations).

**🔋 Resource Constraints**: Agents must manage consumables such as stamina, vehicle battery, and cash to stay operational, sometimes transforming one resource into another (e.g., buying an energy drink to restore stamina).

**⚙️ Physical Constraints**: Environmental dynamics (e.g., temperature, motion, collisions) affect food quality, requiring agents to consider item fragility and perishability in route planning.

**💵 Economic Constraints**: Agents earn income but also pay operational costs (e.g., recharging, renting, buying supplies), forcing them to balance short-term expenses against long-term profit.

**🤝 Social Constraints**: In multi-agent settings, couriers collaborate and compete for limited opportunities (e.g., high-value orders, charging spots), shaping both strategy and outcomes.

### Installation

#### Step 1. Set up the Python client
Make sure to use Python 3.10 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mao1207/DeliveryBench.git
cd DeliveryBench
conda create -n deliverybench python=3.10
conda activate deliverybench
pip install -e .
```

#### Step 2. Download the SimWorld Unreal Engine (UE) server

Download the SimWorld UE server executable from S3 and unzip it. This server renders the 3D city environment and runs the underlying simulation for DeliveryBench. Choose the package that matches your operating system.

- **Windows:** [SimWorld Windows 64-bit Server (v0.1.0)](https://simworld-release.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimWorld-Win64-v0_1_0-Foundation.zip)

- **Linux:** [SimWorld Linux 64-bit Server (v0.1.0)](https://simworld-release.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimWorld-Linux-v0_1_0-Foundation.zip)

### Quick Start

#### Step 1. Launch the SimWorld UE server

Start the SimWorld UE server first, then run the Python examples. From the extracted UE server package directory:

- **Windows:** double-click `gym_citynav.exe`, or launch it from the command line:

  ```bash
  gym_citynav.exe <map_name>
  ```

- **Linux:** run:

  ```bash
  ./gym_citynav.sh <map_name> -RenderOffscreen
  ```

Supported `map_name` options include (examples):

```
small-city-11, medium-city-22, large-city-26
```

See `maps/` for the full list of available cities.


#### Step 2. Configure experiments

Configuration files are under `vlm_delivery/input/`:

* `experiment_config.json`: Experiment-facing settings (e.g., which map to run). Edit this file for most runs.
* `game_mechanics_config.json`: Game mechanics parameters such as vehicle speed/cost and e-scooter charging rate. We recommend keeping this file unchanged to stay aligned with our default experimental setup.

In `experiment_config.json`, make sure the following fields are set correctly:

* `map_name`: Must match the map name used when launching `gym_citynav.exe`
* `ue_port`: Must match the UE server port (default: 9000)
* `multi_agent`: Enable/disable multi-agent mode
* `agent_count`: Number of courier agents to spawn (only used when `multi_agent` is enabled)


For detailed configuration documentation, see [configuration.md](configuration.md).


#### Step 3. Configure models

The VLM model is defined in:

```
vlm_delivery/input/model.json
```

You can directly swap in models supported by **OpenRouter** or **OpenAI** (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, llama-3.1, etc.).

Just replace the model name and corresponding API key fields.

#### Step 4. Run the DeliveryBench evaluation

Open the quick-start notebook:

```
vlm_delivery/scripts/run_deliverybench.ipynb
```

This notebook will:

* connect to the UE server
* spawn courier agents
* run delivery episodes
* log and visualize results

#### Step 5. Analyze results

After runs finish, JSON result files will be exported to the directory specified by `lifecycle.export_path` in `vlm_delivery/input/experiment_config.json`. You can then aggregate them into CSV summaries using:

```bash
python vlm_delivery/evaluation/agent_performance_analysis.py \
  /path/to/result_json_folder \
  -o /path/to/output_dir
```

* `/path/to/result_json_folder` should point to a directory containing one or more JSON result files.
* The script will automatically load **all JSON files in the folder**, compute aggregate statistics (e.g., per-model averages), and write the CSV reports into `/path/to/output_dir`.

## 🧩 Advanced Usage

### Evaluating Custom Models

We also support plugging in **local VLMs**.
As a reference, we provide a minimal implementation of **LLaVA-OneVision** in:

```
vlm_delivery/vlm/base_model.py
```

You can adapt this file to wrap your own local model (e.g., by following the same `forward` / `generate` interface and image/text preprocessing pipeline).

The lightweight agentic workflow (including chain-of-thought reasoning and future planning) is implemented through:

* `vlm_delivery/gameplay/prompt.py` — prompt templates for actions, CoT, and future plans
* `vlm_delivery/gameplay/action_space.py` — parsing model outputs into structured actions
* `vlm_delivery/utils/vlm_prompt.py` — runtime prompt assembly (e.g., feeding the previous plan, observations, or action history back into the model)

You are free to extend this workflow with additional modules, such as:

* **memory modules** (e.g., episodic or long-term memory over past orders and routes)
* **reflection / self-correction loops** (e.g., asking the model to critique or refine its own plan)
* **tool-use modules** (e.g., calling external routing APIs or heuristic planners before acting)

### Running Multiple Environments in Parallel (Multi-Port)

To run multiple DeliveryBench instances in parallel, launch multiple SimWorld UE servers on different ports.

For each instance, edit the port in the extracted UE server package at:

```
gym_citynav/Binaries/Linux/unrealcv.ini
```

Then set the matching port in `vlm_delivery/input/experiment_config.json`:

* `gym_env.ue_port`: Must match the UE server port for that instance

Once each server uses a unique port (e.g., 9000, 9001, 9002, ...), you can run multiple experiments concurrently (one per port).
