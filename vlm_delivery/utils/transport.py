"""
Transport- and energy-related utilities for DeliveryMan agents.

This module implements helper functions that mirror the agent's
internal transport behavior, including:

- Determining towing state
- Calculating effective travel speed
- Changing transport modes with validation
- Applying personal energy consumption
- Applying vehicle (e-scooter) battery consumption
- Unified distance-based consumption handler

All functions operate on a generic `agent` object with the expected fields.
