"""
Context time adjustment utilities.

These helpers manage simple pause/resume behavior for time-based
contexts. A context `ctx` is expected to be a dictionary that contains
timestamps such as:
    - "start_sim": simulation start time
    - "end_sim":   simulation end time
    - "paused_at": time when the context was paused (added dynamically)

Both functions mutate `ctx` in place and safely handle None inputs.
