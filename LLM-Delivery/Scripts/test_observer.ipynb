      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",

      "4) Respect TTLs and quantities. Keep item IDs and counts consistent from purchase to TempBox placement. Use reachable coordinates (meters, like (300.0m, 500.0m)); if uncertain, reuse ones shown on the board.\n",
      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",

      "PRIMARY FLOW (repeat as needed)\n",
      "- Posting as help-seeker:\n",

      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",

      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",

      "4) Respect TTLs and quantities. Keep item IDs and counts consistent from purchase to TempBox placement. Use reachable coordinates (meters, like (300.0m, 500.0m)); if uncertain, reuse ones shown on the board.\n",
      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",
      "6) Funds/capacity: only accept a HELP_BUY if you have capacity and can proceed; if not, skip.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRIMARY FLOW (repeat as needed)\n",
      "- Posting as help-seeker:\n",
      "  • If you have NOT recently posted a HELP_BUY that is still open/active by you and you have sufficient funds, post exactly one HELP_BUY with a short list, a reasonable bounty (e.g., 6.0–8.0), a TTL (10–15 minutes), and a sensible deliver_xy near you.\n",
      "  • Afterwards, periodically VIEW_HELP_BOARD() to monitor status.\n",

      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",

      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",

      "4) Respect TTLs and quantities. Keep item IDs and counts consistent from purchase to TempBox placement. Use reachable coordinates (meters, like (300.0m, 500.0m)); if uncertain, reuse ones shown on the board.\n",
      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",
      "6) Funds/capacity: only accept a HELP_BUY if you have capacity and can proceed; if not, skip.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRIMARY FLOW (repeat as needed)\n",
      "- Posting as help-seeker:\n",
      "  • If you have NOT recently posted a HELP_BUY that is still open/active by you and you have sufficient funds, post exactly one HELP_BUY with a short list, a reasonable bounty (e.g., 6.0–8.0), a TTL (10–15 minutes), and a sensible deliver_xy near you.\n",
      "  • Afterwards, periodically VIEW_HELP_BOARD() to monitor status.\n",
      "  • When the board text indicates the helper has dropped items and shows a helper TempBox location, TAKE_FROM_TEMP_BOX(req_id=...).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Acting as helper:\n",
      "  • Scan the board for OPEN HELP_BUY not posted by you. Prefer feasible ones. Accept only one at a time.\n",
      "  • After ACCEPT_HELP(req_id=...), purchase every required item using the environment’s store commands (one call per item if needed).\n",

      "3) Track your own activity: refer to recent_actions to avoid duplicate posting/accepting. Do not accept multiple HELP_BUY tasks at once.\n",
      "4) Respect TTLs and quantities. Keep item IDs and counts consistent from purchase to TempBox placement. Use reachable coordinates (meters, like (300.0m, 500.0m)); if uncertain, reuse ones shown on the board.\n",
      "5) If acceptance or purchase fails (recent_error), choose the next best valid action (e.g., accept a different req_id, or buy remaining items) instead of repeating an invalid call.\n",
      "6) Funds/capacity: only accept a HELP_BUY if you have capacity and can proceed; if not, skip.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRIMARY FLOW (repeat as needed)\n",
      "- Posting as help-seeker:\n",
      "  • If you have NOT recently posted a HELP_BUY that is still open/active by you and you have sufficient funds, post exactly one HELP_BUY with a short list, a reasonable bounty (e.g., 6.0–8.0), a TTL (10–15 minutes), and a sensible deliver_xy near you.\n",
      "  • Afterwards, periodically VIEW_HELP_BOARD() to monitor status.\n",
